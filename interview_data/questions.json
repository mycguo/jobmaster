Offer Growth Opportunities: identifying high growth individuals and spend time in coaching and mentorships, sending for conferences etc. For example, there is one young graduate who is showing a lot of potential. I used a lot of time one-on-one in coaching him on how to handle more complex projects and how to plan and execute projects. also encourage employees to take on new challenges or projects outside their comfort zones. Foster a Positive Work Culture: I built an environment where team members can communicate openly and freely ( and address any conflicts promptly and fairly.) There is a team lead which tends to make some team members uncomfortable by questioning team members on timelines in a not very friendly manner. I talked with him on the sideline and made sure he understood that his job is to lead technically and let the manager do the people and project management side of things. Avoid micromanagement\u2014trust them to complete tasks in their own way. Give flexibility in work schedules (remote work options, flexible hours). Some of the team members are also studying part time. I encouraged them to continue their study also sometime it does make it difficult to manage projects.
